# 📱 Building Native Android App for Queue Radar

## 🎯 **The Problem**
Expo Go has limitations with native modules like `react-native-maps`. Your app needs a proper development build to access full native functionality.

## ✅ **Solution: Use EAS Build (Recommended)**

### **Option 1: EAS Build (Cloud Build Service)**

1. **Create Expo Account** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   npx expo login
   ```

2. **Initialize EAS**:
   ```bash
   npx eas build:configure
   ```

3. **Build Android APK**:
   ```bash
   npx eas build --platform android --profile preview
   ```

4. **Download & Install**: EAS will provide a download link for your APK

### **Option 2: Local Development Setup (Advanced)**

If you want to build locally, you need to install Android Studio:

1. **Download Android Studio**: https://developer.android.com/studio
2. **Install Android SDK**: SDK 35, Build Tools 35.0.0
3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```
   ANDROID_HOME=C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
   ```
4. **Build Locally**:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```

## 🎉 **Why This Will Fix Your Issues**

### **Current Issues with Expo Go:**
- ❌ Maps don't render properly
- ❌ Limited native module access
- ❌ Stuck on loading screens

### **With Development Build:**
- ✅ **Full react-native-maps support** with Google Maps
- ✅ **Native location services** work perfectly
- ✅ **No more loading issues** - complete native functionality
- ✅ **All your features work**: Firebase, Places API, real-time updates

## 📱 **What You'll Get**

A proper Android APK that you can install on any Android device with:
- 🗺️ **Interactive Google Maps** centered on your location
- 📍 **Real-time location tracking** 
- 🏪 **Nearby salon markers** with ratings and info
- 🔄 **Live Firebase updates** from barber dashboards
- 🎯 **Professional UI** without any Expo Go limitations

## 🚀 **Quick Start (Recommended)**

The fastest way to test your app properly:

```bash
# Login to Expo (create account if needed)
npx expo login

# Build APK (takes ~10-15 minutes)
npx eas build --platform android --profile preview

# Install the APK on your phone when ready
```

**This is the proper way to test React Native apps with native modules!** 🎯

Your app will work perfectly once you have a proper development build instead of using Expo Go.
