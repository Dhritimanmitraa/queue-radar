# Queue Radar - Android APK Build Instructions

## üöÄ Quick Build Options

Since Android SDK is not installed locally, you have **TWO OPTIONS** to build your APK:

---

## Option 1: Cloud Build with EAS (Recommended - Already Set Up)

### Prerequisites
- EAS CLI is already installed ‚úÖ
- Configuration files are ready ‚úÖ

### Steps to Build APK:

1. **Login to Expo Account** (if you don't have one, create free at expo.dev):
   ```bash
   eas login
   ```

2. **Configure the project** (first time only):
   ```bash
   eas build:configure
   ```

3. **Build APK for testing**:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile preview
   ```

4. **Build production APK**:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile production
   ```

The build will run in the cloud. You'll get a URL to download your APK when complete (takes ~10-15 minutes).

## Option 2: Local Build (Requires Android Studio)

If you prefer building locally, you'll need to:

1. **Install Android Studio** from: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - During installation, ensure Android SDK is installed
   - Default location: `C:\Users\dhrit\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`

2. **After installation**, run:
   ```bash
   cd android
   .\gradlew.bat assembleRelease
   ```

3. **Find your APK** at:
   ```
   android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
   ```
